After not updating this blog for a while, I asked Claude (yes, an AI) to take a look at the old workflow and make it better.  It read through my janky bash script, understood the whole Jekyll setup, and built a replacement that honestly makes me wonder why I spent all those hours doing it by hand.  Here's the before and after."

    "* **macOS-only `sed`** - The `sed -i ''` syntax is a macOS-ism that breaks on Linux.\n",
    "* **No front matter management** - You had to manually embed Jekyll front matter (`title`, `author`, `layout`) as a raw cell inside the notebook *before* converting. Forget it and you'd get a post with no title.\n",
    "* **No batch processing** - One notebook at a time, every time.\n",

Removing that friction won't magically generate content, but it removes the excuse.  Now the only hard part is the writing itself - which is how it should be.\n\nOh, and this very post?  It was written as a Jupyter notebook, dropped into `original_posts/`, and published automatically by the pipeline it describes.  The AI built the tool, then the tool published the story about the AI building the tool.  We're through the looking glass here.\n\nIf you have a similar Jekyll + Jupyter setup and want to steal this approach, the full script and workflow are in the [repo](https://github.com/ncho-sqd/ncho-sqd.github.io).  Happy publishing."
