      <p><p><a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/">Divvy</a> is Chicago’s bike share program which works the same way as NYC’s <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/">Citi Bike</a> and Washington DC’s <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">Capital Bikeshare</a>.  You undock a bike from a station, ride it for 30 minutes until you dock it back into any station, with a fee.</p>
