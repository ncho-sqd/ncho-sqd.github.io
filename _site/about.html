<p>My name is Neil and I work as a data analyst in Chicago, IL.</p>

<p>This blog is meant to be a random walk into many of my curiosities where data can provide interesting answers.</p>

<p>I am a Python enthusiast, beer drinker, and foodie in life and interested in personal development and Economics/Finance in general, so topics might revolve around them.</p>

<p>As you can see, this blog is a work in progress.  Letâ€™s see if the Chicago winter can help with it.</p>
