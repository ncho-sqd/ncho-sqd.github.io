<p>My name is Neil and I work as a data analyst in Chicago, IL.</p>

<p>This blog is meant to be a random walk into many of my curiosities where data can provide interesting solutions.</p>

<p>I am a Python enthusiast, beer drinker, and foodie in life and interested in personal development and Economics/Finance in general.</p>

<p>I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in Economics, so Econometrics has been my go-to toolkit for understanding the data universe but Iâ€™ve been expanding my horizon into other Machine Learning techniques as well.</p>
