title: About

My name is Neil. I'm a Chicago-based quantitative researcher with a decade of experience building data-driven systems at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and algorithmic decision-making.

My day-to-day revolves around NLP, statistical modeling, and turning messy real-world data into something actionable. I'm a UChicago Economics grad, so Econometrics was my first language — but over the years I've gone deep into ML, optimization, and large-scale data pipelines.

This blog is a random walk into my curiosities where data can provide interesting solutions and inspirations. I'm a Pythonista, interested in personal finance, trading, and Economics/Finance in general.
