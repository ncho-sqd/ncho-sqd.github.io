My name is Neil. I'm a Chicago-based quant who builds data-driven systems and all sorts of algorithmic decision-making tools as a job and a hobby.

My day-to-day revolves around turning messy real-world data into something actionable — whether that's wrangling unstructured text into clean features, building models that surface signal from noise, or designing pipelines that make the whole thing run at scale.

This blog is a random walk into my curiosities and innovations related to data, compute, and AI. I write about things I find genuinely interesting — from NLP experiments on tens of thousands of books to automating workflows that were slowing me down. If something sparks a question worth exploring with code and data, it'll probably end up here.

Thanks for stopping by — hope you find something that sparks your curiosity too.
