My name is Neil and I am a data scientist living in Chicago.

This blog is meant to be a random walk into many of my curiosities where data can provide interesting solutions and inspirations.

I am a Pythonista, crypto enthusiast, budding mixologist and interested in personal finance, trading, and Economics/Finance in general.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in Economics, so Econometrics has been my go-to toolkit for understanding the wonderful universe of data but I am expanding my horizon into other Machine Learning techniques as well.
