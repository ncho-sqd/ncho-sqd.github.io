# About me

My name is Neil and I work as a data analyst in Chicago.

This blog is meant to be a "random walk" into many of my curiosities where data can provide interesting answers.

I am a Python enthusiast, beer drinker, and foodie in life and interested in personal finance/development and Economics/Finance in general, so those might be some "drifts". 

As you can see, this blog is a work in progress.  Let's see if the Chicago winter will help with that.
