# About me

My name is Neil and I work as a data analyst in Chicago, IL.

This blog is meant to be a random walk into many of my curiosities where data can provide interesting answers.

I am a Python enthusiast, beer drinker, and foodie in life and interested in personal development and Economics/Finance in general, so topics might revolve around them.

As you can see, this blog is a work in progress.  Let's see if the Chicago winter can help with it.
