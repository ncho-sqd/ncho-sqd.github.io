# About me

My name is Neil and I work as a data analyst in Chicago, IL.

This blog is meant to be a random walk into many of my curiosities where data can provide interesting solutions.

I am a Python enthusiast, beer drinker, and foodie in life and interested in personal development and Economics/Finance in general.

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in Economics, so Econometrics has been my go-to toolkit for understanding the data universe but I've been expanding my horizon into other Machine Learning techniques as well.
